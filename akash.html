      <h3>Strong communication skills</h3>
      <p>Lawyers must have strong oral communication skills and written communication skills to accurately relay critical legal information. As well, a significant portion of a lawyerâ€™s job is to create strong and convincing arguments which are presented in the courtroom. Judges and juries all have their own opinions, beliefs, and backgrounds so a lawyerâ€™s ability must be able to reach out to all of them and convince accordingly.</p>
